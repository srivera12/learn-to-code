          timbers! Me I’m Dishonest. And A Dishonest Man You Can Always Trust To Be Dishonest. Honestly Its The Honest
          Ones You Want To Watch Out For Because You Never Know When They Are Going To Do Something Completely Stupid!
          Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really
          nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. Work like a captain, play like a pirate. Piracy – Hostile take
          over.

          untrustworthy because you can always trust that they will be untrustworthy. Its the trustworthy you can’t
          trust. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is
          really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. Shiver me timbers.

          we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates. you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man
          sail away with my ship. Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all. “Yes, I do
          heartily repent. I repent I had not done more mischief; and that we did not cut the throats of them that took
          us, and I am extremely sorry that you aren’t hanged as well as we. ”
