        It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better
        demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores
        our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only
        home we've ever known.

          “From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: ‘Tough’ and ‘Competent.’ Tough means we are
          forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities.
          Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we will never take
          anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be
          perfect.

          The view of the earth from the moon fascinated me - a small disk, 240,000 mniles away. It was hard to think
          that that little thing held so many problems, so many frustrations. Raging nationalistic interests, famines,
          wars, pestilence don't show from that distance. I'm convinced that some wayward stranger in a space-craft,
          coming from some other part of the heavens, could look at earth and never know that it was inhabited at all.
          But the samw wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively that if the earth were inhabited, then the
          destinies of all who lived on it must inevitably be interwoven and joined. We are one hunk of ground, water,
          air, clouds, floating around in space. From out there it really is 'one world'.

          I believe that space travel will one day become as common as airline travel is today. I’m convinced, however,
          that the true future of space travel does not lie with government agencies — NASA is still obsessed with the
          idea that the primary purpose of the space program is science — but real progress will come from private
          companies competing to provide the ultimate adventure ride, and NASA will receive the trickle-down benefits.

          The most significant things we can think about, when we think about Apollo, is that it has opened for us, for
          us being the World, a challenge of the future. The door is now cracked, but the promise of that future lies in
          the young people, not just in America, but the young people all over the world. Learning to live and learning
          to work together. In order to remind all the peoples of the World, in so many countries throughout the world,
          that this is what we all are striving for in the future, Jack has picked up a very significant rock, typical
          of what we have here in the valley of Taurus Littrow. It's a rock composed of many fragments, of many sizes,
          and many shapes, probably from all parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old. But a rock of all sizes
          and shapes, fragments of all sizes and shapes, and even colors that have grown together to become a cohesive
          rock outlasting the nature of Space, sort of living together in a very coherent, very peaceful manner. When we
          return this rock or some of the others like it to Houston, we'd like to share a piece of this rock with so
          many of the countries throughout the world. We hope that this will be a symbol of what our feelings are, what
          the feelings of the Apollo Program are, and a symbol of mankind that we can live in peace and harmony in the
          future.

          The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those
          generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of
          a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
          distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to
          kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

          We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because
          they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our
          energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
          postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.

      <h2>The Final Frontier?</h2>
      <p>
        There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all.
        Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come
        again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest
        mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?
