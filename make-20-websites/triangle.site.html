            this? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Then maybe you should
            consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. You're going to
            be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Well, that's certainly good to know. How long can two people talk
            about nothing? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Wouldn't that
            bring about chaos? Not if I weaken first. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.
            Sorry, Data. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement.

            A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. They were just sucked
            into space. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. A lot of things can change in twelve
            years, Admiral. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Earl Grey tea, watercress
            sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? What's a knock-out like you doing in a
            computer-generated gin joint like this? Talk about going nowhere fast. But the probability of making a six
            is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh.

            Ensign Babyface! Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? We have a
            saboteur aboard. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human
            history would be far less bloody. The unexpected is our normal routine. Flair is what marks the difference
            between artistry and mere competence. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in
            others. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.

            Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I
            looked. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by
            insanity, but I am not insane. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? In all trust, there is the possibility for
            betrayal. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Then maybe you should consider this:

            I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Wait
            a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Our neural pathways have become
            accustomed to your sensory input patterns. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the
            assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer.
            And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty
            to Starfleet. Computer, lights up! Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?
